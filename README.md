# Inventory Management Dashboard 
## Project Objective 
The primary objective of this dashboard is to analyze inventory performance using ABC-XYZ segmentation, visualize critical metrics like revenue distribution, turnover ratio, warehouse value, and Days on Hand, and enable data-driven decision-making for inventory replenishment, demand forecasting, and resource allocation.
## Questions 
This dashboard addresses the following key questions:
1.	Which products should be prioritized for reordering?
2.	Which products are overstocked or understocked?
3.	How many days will it take to clear the stock for products that are overstocked and have low demand?
4.	How are products performing across categories?
5.	What is the future demand trend?
6.	What is the current value of the warehouse?
7.	What is the turnover ratio?
8.	How many days on hand?
9.	What are the average lead times?

## Process
•	Verified data for missing values and anomalies, and resolved them appropriately.
•	Ensured data consistency and cleanliness in terms of data types, formats, and values
•	Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
•	Combined all pivot tables into a single dynamic dashboard using slicers.

## Project Insights
•	ABC-XYZ Analysis: Identified high-value, high-turnover products (A-X category) that drive revenue but require frequent replenishment.
•	Heatmaps: Highlighted areas of inefficiency, such as low turnover ratios in certain categories (e.g., C-Z).
•	Demand Forecasting : Predicted future demand trends to prevent stockouts and overstocking.
•	Dynamic Filtering : Enabled users to analyze specific product categories (A, B, C, X, Y, Z) and prioritize actions based on real-time data.

# Conclusion
This inventory dashboard is designed to make inventory management easier and more efficient. By using visualizations, segmenting data, and predicting future trends, it helps users make smarter decisions about restocking, managing resources, and planning for demand. Whether you're handling a small inventory or growing your operations, this dashboard gives you the insights you need to save time, cut costs, and keep everything running smoothly.
